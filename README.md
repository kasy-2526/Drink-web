Project Title: Beverage Hub

Description:

Beverage Hub is a sleek, modern, single-page web application designed for browsing and ordering a curated selection of beverages. Built purely with foundational web technologies—HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript—this project demonstrates a complete and responsive e-commerce front-end experience without relying on external frameworks.

Key Features:

Immersive Dark Theme: The user interface is crafted with a sophisticated dark theme, utilizing the Tailwind CSS framework for a fully responsive and mobile-first layout. The aesthetic is clean, modern, and easy on the eyes.

Dynamic Hero Section: The homepage greets users with an animated hero carousel that elegantly cycles through high-quality images of featured drinks, creating an engaging first impression.

Interactive Product Catalog: The main section dynamically renders a list of signature beverages from a JavaScript array. Each product card displays an image, name, price in Indian Rupees (₹), and an "Add to Cart" button.

Floating Cart & Sidebar: To ensure a non-intrusive user experience, the shopping cart is implemented as a floating button with an item counter. Clicking it smoothly slides out a sidebar that displays all selected items, quantities, and the running total.

Simulated Payment Modal: The checkout process is handled through a pop-up modal that appears when the user proceeds to payment. It displays a dummy QR code to simulate the final step of the transaction.

Pure JavaScript Functionality: All client-side logic, including rendering products, managing the cart state (adding items, calculating totals), and handling UI events for the sidebar and modal, is powered by clean, efficient vanilla JavaScript.

This project serves as an excellent example of a visually appealing and functional e-commerce front-end, showcasing strong fundamentals in HTML structure, CSS styling (including custom animations), and core JavaScript logic.
